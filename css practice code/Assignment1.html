        Whosaid—“Twovastandtrunklesslegsofstone<br/>
        Standinthedesert....Nearthem,onthesand,<br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br  >
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br >
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br  >
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br >
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br  >
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br >
        My name is   <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings; <br >
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br />
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br >
        of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.  <br>
